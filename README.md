# happy-gas-website
The official website of Happy Gas Improv: Kentucky's longest-running improv comedy troupe. I was a part of this troupe from 2015-2019, serving as President for 2018-2019. I built this website using Bootstrap 3, expanding on a simple open-source template I found.

Features I added included: Photo captions, troupe member modals with descriptions, page navigation, and major UI decisions of the site.

To my knowledge, the website should be live at https://happygasimprov.com
